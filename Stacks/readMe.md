# Stack Implementations in C++

This repository contains two different implementations of the Stack data structure in C++: one using a linked list and the other using an array. Each implementation demonstrates basic stack functionalities such as push, pop, and display operations.

## Functionality Overview

### Stack using Linked List
- **Dynamic Size**: Stack grows dynamically as new elements are added.
- **Push/Pop**: Supports pushing elements onto the stack and popping elements off the stack.
- **Display**: Allows displaying the current elements in the stack.

### Stack using Array
- **Fixed Size**: Stack has a predetermined size set during initialization.
- **Push/Pop**: Allows elements to be pushed and popped from the stack.
- **Display**: Provides functionality to display the stack's current state.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Stack using Linked List
- **Advantages**:
  - Dynamic memory allocation, so it can grow as needed.
  - No need to define a maximum stack size in advance.
  
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Slightly slower due to the overhead of dynamic memory allocation.
  - Additional memory usage for pointers.
  
### Stack using Array
- **Advantages**:
  - Faster operations since memory is contiguous and fixed.
  - Simpler implementation with no need for pointer handling.
  
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Requires defining the maximum size at the start, leading to potential waste of memory or overflow.
  - Static size limits flexibility.

## Comparison of Both Implementations

| Feature                    | Linked List Implementation | Array Implementation      |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Memory Usage**            | Dynamic, grows as needed    | Static, fixed at initialization |
| **Performance**             | Slower due to dynamic allocation | Faster due to contiguous memory |
| **Complexity**              | More complex (pointers, dynamic memory) | Simpler (fixed size, no pointers) |
| **Flexibility**             | More flexible, no size limits | Less flexible, size limit is fixed |
| **Use Case**                | Better for unpredictable size | Better for performance in small, fixed-size scenarios |
