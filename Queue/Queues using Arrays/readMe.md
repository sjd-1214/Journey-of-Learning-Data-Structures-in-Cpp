# Circular and Linear Queues

## 1. Functionality

### Linear Queue
A **Linear Queue** is a data structure that follows the **First In First Out (FIFO)** principle. This means that the element added first will be removed first. Linear Queues are implemented using arrays or linked lists, where elements are inserted from the rear and removed from the front.

**Operations:**
- **Enqueue**: Insert an element at the rear.
- **Dequeue**: Remove an element from the front.
- **Peek**: View the element at the front without removing it.
- **isFull**: Check if the queue is full (for a fixed-size queue).
- **isEmpty**: Check if the queue is empty.

### Circular Queue
A **Circular Queue** is an advanced version of the linear queue where the last position is connected back to the first position, forming a circle. This overcomes the limitation of the linear queue where, after multiple enqueue and dequeue operations, empty spaces are left unused at the front.

**Operations:**
- **Enqueue**: Insert an element at the rear.
- **Dequeue**: Remove an element from the front.
- **Peek**: View the element at the front without removing it.
- **isFull**: Check if the queue is full.
- **isEmpty**: Check if the queue is empty.

## 2. Purpose (Why Queues?)

Queues are essential for handling scenarios where elements need to be processed in the exact order they arrived. The **FIFO** structure makes them perfect for managing data flow, resource scheduling, or task management in operating systems, network communication, and even everyday applications like customer service ticketing systems.

Queues ensure that:
- Processes are managed in a sequential order.
- Tasks are performed without skipping or bypassing.
- Resources are used efficiently.

## 3. Difference between Circular and Linear Queues

| **Aspect**                    | **Linear Queue**                           | **Circular Queue**                          |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Structure**                  | Straight-line data structure.              | Circular structure where rear connects to front. |
| **Space Utilization**          | Wastes space once the front moves ahead.   | Optimizes space by reusing empty positions. |
| **End Condition**              | Becomes full when the rear reaches the last position. | Becomes full when rear is just before the front. |
| **Efficiency**                 | Less efficient as empty spaces remain unused. | More efficient with better space utilization. |
| **Complexity of Implementation**| Simpler to implement.                      | Slightly complex due to wrapping around.    |

## 4. Where Queues are Used?

Queues play a critical role in various real-world applications, including but not limited to:

- **Operating Systems**: Managing CPU tasks in process scheduling.
- **Printers**: Organizing print jobs in the order they are received.
- **Customer Service**: Managing the sequence of support tickets or calls.
- **Networking**: Queuing packets for transmission in routers and switches.
- **Simulations**: Event-driven simulations where events occur in a specific order.
