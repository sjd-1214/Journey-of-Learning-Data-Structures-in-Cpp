# Singly Linked List and Doubly Linked List

This document provides a concise overview of **Singly Linked Lists (SLL)** and **Doubly Linked Lists (DLL)**, highlighting their key operations, advantages, and disadvantages. These data structures form the foundation of many algorithms and are crucial in various computer science applications.

## Singly Linked List (SLL)

A **Singly Linked List (SLL)** is a sequence of nodes where each node contains:
1. **Data**: The value stored in the node.
2. **Pointer to the next node**: A reference to the next node in the list.

In an SLL:
- The list starts from a **head** node and continues until a node points to `NULL`, marking the end of the list.
- Nodes can only be traversed in one direction (forward).
- Basic operations include insertion and deletion at various positions within the list.

### Key Operations
- **Insert at the End**: Adds a node at the end of the list by traversing the nodes until the last node is found.
- **Insert at the Start**: Adds a new node before the head node, making it the new head.
- **Insert at a Specific Position**: Inserts a node at a specified position by adjusting the pointers of adjacent nodes.
- **Delete from the End**: Removes the last node by updating the second-to-last node’s pointer to `NULL`.
- **Delete from the Start**: Removes the head node and sets the next node as the new head.
- **Delete from a Specific Position**: Removes a node from a specific position by adjusting the surrounding pointers.

### Advantages
- **Efficient Memory Usage**: Only requires a single pointer for each node.
- **Ease of Insertions/Deletions**: No need to shift elements as in arrays, making insertions and deletions efficient, especially at the beginning or end of the list.

### Disadvantages
- **No Backward Traversal**: Once you move forward, you cannot go back to previous nodes.
- **Sequential Access**: Searching for elements requires traversing the list from the head, as there is no direct access to any node.

## Doubly Linked List (DLL)

A **Doubly Linked List (DLL)** expands upon the SLL by adding an extra pointer in each node. Each node contains:
1. **Data**: The value stored in the node.
2. **Pointer to the next node**: A reference to the next node in the list.
3. **Pointer to the previous node**: A reference to the previous node, allowing traversal in both directions.

In a DLL:
- Nodes can be traversed in both forward and backward directions.
- Each node points to both its previous and next nodes, providing more flexibility in operations such as insertion and deletion.

### Key Operations
- **Insert at the Start**: Inserts a new node at the beginning, adjusting the pointers of both the new node and the previous head.
- **Insert at the End**: Adds a new node at the end of the list, updating the previous last node’s next pointer and the new node’s previous pointer.
- **Insert in the Middle**: Inserts a node at a specific position, adjusting both the next and previous pointers of adjacent nodes.
- **Delete from the Start**: Removes the head node, updating the next node’s previous pointer to `NULL`.
- **Delete from the End**: Removes the last node by setting the second-to-last node’s next pointer to `NULL`.
- **Delete from the Middle**: Deletes a node by updating the pointers of both the previous and next nodes to bypass the node being removed.

### Advantages
- **Bidirectional Traversal**: Nodes can be traversed in both directions, making it easier to implement certain algorithms.
- **Efficient Middle Operations**: Insertion and deletion in the middle of the list are more efficient as you have access to both the previous and next nodes.

### Disadvantages
- **Increased Memory Usage**: Each node requires an additional pointer to store the reference to the previous node.
- **Complexity**: The implementation is more complex compared to SLL, due to the need to maintain two pointers for each node.

## Comparison of SLL and DLL

| Feature                    | Singly Linked List (SLL)        | Doubly Linked List (DLL)        |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Traversal**               | Only forward                   | Forward and backward            |
| **Memory Usage**            | Lower (one pointer per node)    | Higher (two pointers per node)  |
| **Insertion/Deletion**      | Easy at start or end            | Efficient at both start, end, and middle |
| **Complexity**              | Simpler implementation          | More complex due to additional pointers |
| **Use Cases**               | Suitable when backward traversal is not needed | Preferred when bidirectional traversal is required |

## Use Cases

- **Singly Linked List** is ideal when memory efficiency is a priority and only forward traversal is needed.
- **Doubly Linked List** is preferred when bidirectional traversal is required, such as in **browser history**, **undo functionality**, and **deque (double-ended queue)** implementations.
